\section{Solutions to Exercises}

\subsection{Chapter 1}
\textbf{Exercise 1:} We wish to prove that the intercept $y_{00}$ is given by equation: 
\begin{equation}
y_{00} = \frac{x_{21} \cdot y_1 - x_{11} \cdot y_2}{x_{21} - x_{11}}
\end{equation}
We will start by adding and removing the term $x_{11} \cdot y_1$:
\begin{equation}
\frac{x_{21} \cdot y_1 - x_{11} \cdot y_2 } {x_{21} - x_{11}}  = 
\frac{x_{21} \cdot y_1 - x_{11} \cdot y_2 + x_{11} \cdot y_1 - x_{11} \cdot y_1} {x_{21} - x_{11}} 
\end{equation}
By reorganizing the terms we get:
\begin{equation}
\frac{x_{21} \cdot y_1 - x_{11} \cdot y_1 - x_{11} \cdot y_2 + x_{11} \cdot y_1} {x_{21} - x_{11}} 
\end{equation}
By factorizing the re-ordered terms we obtain:
\begin{equation}
\frac{y_1 \cdot (x_{21} - x_{11}) - x_{11} \cdot (y_2 + y_1)} {x_{21} - x_{11}} 
\end{equation}
which leads to:
\begin{equation}
y_1 - x_{11} \cdot \frac{y_2 + y_1} {x_{21} - x_{11}} = y_1 - x_{11} \cdot \tan \alpha
\end{equation}
which is the value of the intercept, as it can be seen from Figure \ref{fig.simple_line}.

\textbf{Exercise 2:} 
Let us start by importing the Matrix class from sympy and then creating 2 matrix objects, one for storing the X matrix (Equation \ref{x_matrix_2d}) and the other for storing the Y vector (Equation \ref{y_matrix_2d}). Computing w is obtaind by applying Equation \ref{equation_for_w_2d_example}
. 
\begin{lstlisting}
from sympy import Matrix
X = Matrix([[1, 1, 4], [1, 2, -2], [1, 6, 2]])
Y = Matrix([[1],[6],[12]])
w = X.inv() * Y
\end{lstlisting}
We can now inspect the w vector:
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> w
Matrix([
[   1],
[   2],
[-1/2]])
\end{lstlisting}
